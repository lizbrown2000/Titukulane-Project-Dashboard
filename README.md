# Titukulane-Project-Dashboard
This page provides a non-technical overview of progress towards the TTK costing study

## Policy Context

Titukulane is a $75 million investment in a Resilience Food Security Activity (RSFA) being implemented in Malawi over five years from 2021-2025. It specifically supports Malawi’s National Resilience Strategy (NRS) which seeks to build household, community, and system-level resilience to chronic food and nutrition insecurity.2 Goals for Titukulane include achieving sustainable, equitable, and resilient food and nutrition security for over 290,000 ultra-poor and chronically vulnerable households in the Mangochi and Zomba districts of Malawi.

## Project Goals

The goal of our analysis is to understand better understand the costs and cost efficiency of both the Titukulane program as well as the Takunda program, its sister program in Zambia. Our hope is that this analysis will help USAID and CARE effectively allocate resources in future RFS activities. Specifically, this analysis will focus on five primary questions:

1) **Cost and cost-efficiency**: What is the total, average, and incremental cost; what is the cost per house-hold (i.e. cost-efficiency)?
2) **Cost contribution**: What share does each of the intervention services contribute to the total cost of the Full Program?
3) **Comparative cost-effectiveness**: Is it more cost-effective to invest in a full program or target a subset of program activities?
4) **Sensitivity**: Are the cost-effectiveness ratios sensitive to the key assumptions of the costing study? To what extent?

In addition, we will use this project to develop tools and templates for other research practictioners to use as a resource for costing analysis. The primary tool will be a costing Pre-Analysis Plan, which will show researchers how to plan for a costing analysis, and some of the pertinent questions they should aim to answer. This Github repository will also act as a tool for researchers who are interested in the more granular coding decisions that we used in our analysis.

## Repo set up

The repository is divided into three primary folders:

1. Initial Data Analysis: This folder shows intial descriptive analysis that was done of the dataset to understand the structure of the data and to develop questions for the CARE finance team.
2. Data Preparation: This folder includes all of the files used to create a clean dataset from the raw data, as well as to allocate line items into costing categories to be used in the core analysis.
3. Core Analysis: This includes all files used to answer the questions listed in the project goals.
4. Costing Tools: This folder includes the code used to generate products for the broader research community, such as the costing pre-analysis plan.
